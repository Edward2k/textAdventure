      "description": "Hozier? Is that you?! Did somebody finally take you to church or did you take the tram here as well? God, you really are sleep-deprived. Looks like the rats have no respect for a holy place - you think to yourself as you see another rat poison"

      "description": "Although the lightning is dim you can see a water bottle standing on a table in the south corner of the lobby. And of course, as the whole Amsterdam is, the VU is also dealing with pest infestation - you think to yourself as you spot a rat poison laying on the ground. Thinking of this, thankfully, makes your late night cravings disappear."

      "description":  "What a temptation! A fully stocked Spar with even less security than usual, but the techno music is still on! Maybe a little bit wouldn't hurt - you think to yourself when you notice a slice of pizza out of the corner of your eye."

The sound of the birds makes you relax and for a second you even forget all the stress you re going through in this sleep-deprived adventure. LOOK OUT!! There is a sleeping Donkey Kong in the corner about to wake up."

      "name": "Maintenance Closet",
      "description": "You find your self in a very small space. It must be less than 5 square meters in here! It's almost as big as your overpriced Amsterdam studio apartment! As you are no stranger to this confined space you can see that the room you are in is a maintenance closet - there is a broom, a mop, a bleach bottle, plastic gloves... But perhaps the most interesting thing are the night vision goggles on the top of the shelf."

      "description": "What an unfamiliar place, the TA office. You wonder whether they talk about you during their meetings and how you have missed almost all of the practicals. On top of the stack of graded papers, someone has forgotten their TA card - fancy a free coffee?"

      "name": "Fish Bowl",
      "description": "Ohh, the fish bowl class, you can never focus on what the lecturer is saying with so many things happening around you. You've never seen this room so empty as you always arrive late to class and there are no seats left. Next to some white board markers you see yet another rat poison, maybe this university should hire someone to deal with this problem professionally. "
